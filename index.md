This project aims to address the paradox of choice in the movie industry by developing two recommender engines, one based on non-personalized attributes and the other utilizing user-based collaborative filtering. The recommender engines utilize cosine similarity algorithms and TensorFlow-based user-based collaborative filtering to provide personalized movie recommendations, incorporating factors such as movie popularity, ratings, and film age to enhance decision-making processes for users. The project also includes exploratory data analysis on IMDb and Movie Lens 1m datasets to uncover insights relevant to stakeholders in the movie industry.
